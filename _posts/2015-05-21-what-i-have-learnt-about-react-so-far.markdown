A few days ago, I read the Japanese edition of "[Developing a React Edge](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902122.do?sortby=publicationDate)". I was so impressed that I played with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to learn it. It was very fun!

Yesterday I did a presentation (lightning talk) at [Shibuya.rb](https://shibuyarb.doorkeeper.jp/), a local Ruby meetup in Tokyo, Japan. I presented my thoughts from reading the book.

Here you can see the slideshow. Click each slide to move to the next page. It is also published on [GitHub Pages](http://kyanny.github.io/what-i-have-learnt-about-react-so-far/).
