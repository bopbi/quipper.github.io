A few days ago, I read Japanese edition of "[Developing a React Edge](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902122.do?sortby=publicationDate)" book. I am so impressed that I played with React to learn it. It was very fun.

Yesterday I did a presentation (lightning talks) at Shibuya.rb, a local Ruby meetup in Tokyo, Japan. I introduced what I thought after reading the book.

Here is a slide. Click slide to move next page. It also published at [GitHub Pages](http://kyanny.github.io/what-i-have-learnt-about-react-so-far/).
